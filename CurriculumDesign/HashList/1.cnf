Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Actions

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Actions

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Actions

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Actions

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Actions

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Actions

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Actions

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

In 2018, China launched the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which attracted over 3,600 companies from around the world and more than 400,000 Chinese and foreign buyers. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a total of $57.8 billion were reached at the six-day event.

The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. Over the past three years, the lender has approved financing worth $7 billion for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.

In July 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, the first ever cross-sea bridge for the Indian Ocean nation, was completed. The bridge is deemed one of the landmark projects of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

In fact, nearly 170 countries and international organizations have signed BRI-related cooperation documents with China.

The BRI is a manifestation of China's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, said John Allen, former vice-chairman of the UN Business Council.

Future of hope

China's General Administration of Customs said that in 2018 the country's foreign trade rose 9.7 percent year-on-year to a record high of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.5 trillion).

The numbers demonstrate China's resilience after 40 years of reform and opening-up, even at a time when unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.

In April, Xi announced a series of new measures for expanding China's reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.

The new initiatives included easing foreign shareholding restrictions in the auto, shipping and aviation industries, and implementing a management system based on national treatment and a negative list.

Over the past two years, China has been promoting innovation and improving inclusive development amid external uncertainties. On such issues as the Korean Peninsula, the Syrian crisis and UN peacekeeping operations, China is committed to safeguarding global peace and stability.

Gai Lin, secretary-general of the EU-China Friendship Group of the European Parliament, said the future of mankind will surely involve bringing together nations in a spirit of cooperation. Building a community with a shared future is undoubtedly the best option for safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
Beijing, the capital of China, remained the most attractive city for Chinese graduates, followed by Shenzhen and Shanghai, National Business Daily reported.

The conclusion was based on 11 graduate employment quality reports from C9, a bloc of nine reputed Chinese universities, including Tsinghua University and Peking University, as well as Wuhan University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, an increasing number of young Chinese graduates are leaving Beijing for other first-tier cities or even new first-tier cities, due to the high cost of living, conditions and traffic congestion factors, the reports showed.

Meanwhile, new first-tier cities have become a new magnetic field to attract talents. According to the annual College Graduates' Employment Report issued in June, 40.18 percent of college graduates chose to work in new first-tier cities, up 2.68 percent year-on-year.

Let's take a look at the 10 most attractive cities for Chinese graduates.

Past two years saw world supporting president's Geneva speech proposal

Two years ago, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the United Nations office in Geneva in which he called for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Two years on, the appeal ！ which represents a vision of common development and progress ！ has gained widespread support and built synergy in the international community to pursue a better shared future.

In harmony with all

"China has been a strong pillar of multilateralism," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, highlighting that the aim of multilateralism is to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

Over the past two years, the appeal by the Chinese leader has been incorporated into various documents, including UN Security Council resolutions, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Qingdao Declaration of the Council of Heads of Member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Action Plan (2019-21).

The Chinese appeal, with its foresight and wisdom, has witnessed tremendous changes across the globe and resonates with people's longing for peaceful development.

As China hosted a number of significant diplomatic events and Chinese leaders paid visits abroad, the idea of building a community with a shared future has been increasingly accepted worldwide.

"It is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflicts, one with equal development opportunities and with all people blessed with happiness," said Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister.
